# valleyTERM
Yet another VTE wrapper. This time made and customized by me.</br>
If anyone is wondering why "valley" is in the name, it's because "valley" is a fairly common handle that I use.

Features:
1. It is fairly minimal.
2. The settings are hard-coded.
3. I'm starting to realize that these might not be features for most people.

Note: You might have to take a look through the source and change what you want. Especially the font.</br>
Don't worry; I made sure to comment things, so it shouldn't be too hard.

Dependencies: vte-2.91 and gtk.

How to use:
1. Either download [term.c](https://github.com/Phate6660/term/blob/master/term.c) or clone the repository.
2. Compile: `make && sudo make install`.
3. Profit: `valleyTERM`.
